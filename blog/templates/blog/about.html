                    Hello, thank you for visiting my about me page on my website.
                    I've created this page to give you a little more background information about myself and to
                    showcase some of the awesome projects I've worked on.

                </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1s">
                    I was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts on March 25th, 1996.
                    I attended the public school system in Holyoke from elementary school to high school,
                    and eventually started my college career at the Holyoke Community College (for financial reasons).
                    Even though I knew my way around computers, I wasn't always a computer science major.
                    When I started college I was a Biology major. I had intentions to become a medical doctor, but
                    after completing my first semester I realized that I wanted to challenge myself more.
                    Around this time I discovered my love for computer science.
                    This was a field that was growing rapidly and didn't make me feel like the knowledge I was gaining was limited
                    to a career goal.
                    My second semester I began my computer science degree and started learning to program. What I loved
                    the most about computer science was that the knowledge I gained could be applied to other topics as well.
                    I was not just limited to learning about computer science, but my knowledge could be used to help
                    people in other fields. I completed my BS at the University of Massachusetts's in Amherst in 2018 and
                    do not regret my decision at all.
                </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s">
                    I've been into software development for 5 years and have worked on projects ranging
                    from simple text based games for personal leisure to full scale inventory management applications
                    for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In my free time I create gameplay assist applications
                    for a popular video game known as Runescape, and also like to explore hardware such as high speed drones
                    and custom RGB LED fixtures.
                </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1s">
                    My expertise is in Java and Python development. A vast majority of my work has been on
                    back-end development. For about a year now I've been teaching myself front-end development.
                    Through this I have learned to work with the Django framework, and use some design languages such as
                    HTML, CSS and bootstrap. In fact, that's how you're viewing this page right now!
                </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s">
                    I love to cook and listen to music when I'm not programming. My dream is to start my own company and
                    help people like myself find a passion in programming.
                    If you'd like to reach out to me for a job interview or would just like to have a chat
                    feel free to reach me at my personal email (omarsanchezdev@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you!
